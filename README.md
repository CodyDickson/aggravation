The board game Aggravation in Java

This is a recreation of the board game Aggravation in Java. It was a group project for the final project of Advanced Java. The game board itself was designed by classmates but the gameplay was all written by me. The BoardGame Java class, found in the src/Aggravation folder, is the main class that features the logic and gameplay of the game.
